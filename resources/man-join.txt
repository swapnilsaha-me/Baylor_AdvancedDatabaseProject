The natural join operator will take three parameters
	-The name of the first file
	-The name of the second file
	-The name of the output file


Example: join f1 f2 oname
	-The operator determines the common attributes between f1 and f2
	-The operator uses your cross product operator to generate the cross product of f1 and f2, storing the result in a file
	-The operator uses the select operator as many times as needed, to select the rows which satisfy the natural join constraint. Each intermediate result should be stored in a file.
	-The operator uses the project operator one time to eliminate duplicate columns between f1 and f2
