The projection operator will take a variable number of parameters, the first is the name of the input file, 
the second is the name of the output file and then one for each attribute to be returned in the result. 
If there is only one parameter, return the entire row.

Example: project fname oname A B C
	- Creates a new header row with attributes A B and C.
	- Sequentially access each row, extracting the values for those columns

Example Query-
Query >> project db.csv out.csv
Query >> project db.csv out.csv id marks age
