The btree operator takes one parameter, the name of a b+tree file. The operator generates a human readable output 
of a btree, including all pointers. All btrees are assumed to have 100 pointers.

*Note: You may want to create a B+ tree using a select command, e.g. select db.csv out.csv id 5


Example Query-
Query >> btree db.csv.id.btree
